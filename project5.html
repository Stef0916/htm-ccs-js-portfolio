        <h2>Summary and Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In the present study, the coordination of nickel with an alloxazine-based bioinspired ligand was studied and yielded
             a trinuclear Ni(II) complex denoted 1, featuring three redox-active ligands comprised of a catechol and a 
             flavin-related alloxazine moiety (Scheme 1). Here, we report an exhaustive analysis of this unique trinuclear 
             complex's electronic structure and magnetic properties using quantum chemical approaches. Further information 
             regarding the experimental details of this study can be found in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d1qi01131f" target="_blank">publication</a>

            Several methods were used in the study of this trinuclear nickel complex to elucidate its electronic 
            structure. Among these methods, we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) specifically to assist in 
            interpreting the experimental results, which include EPR, SQUID, mass spectrometry, and X-ray analysis. 
            This helped shed light on the most probable electronic states of the system. For further details on all 
            the listed calculations and computational aspects, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d1qi01131f" target="_blank">View Publication</a>).

    <h2>Implementation and Results</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><u><b>Electronic structure:</b></u></p>
    <p>
        Catechols and alloxazines both stabilize radicals when bound to metals. For alloxazines, protonation can occur on the 
        pyrazine ring nitrogens (Scheme 1). Thus, it's plausible the complex could be partly or fully protonated, allowing magnetic
         coupling between the Ni(II) ions and the ligand's organic radicals (SQ.) (Scheme 2). In fact, X-ray analysis of the 
         solid-state structure reveals Ni(II) centres influenced by varying electronic environments from interactions with water 
         and DMF molecules. This structure also hints at partial protonation in the alloxazine sections based on C-N distances. 
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        To differentiate these possibilities and clarify the ligand's protonation and radical states in the trinuclear complex 1, DFT 
        calculations were done. According to Scheme 2, three configurations were examined with three high-spin Ni(II) ions each: 
        one with three protons and radicals, another with two of each, and the last with just one proton and either one or three 
        radicals. All models underwent geometry optimizations, and their free energies were determined.

            different protonated configurations considered for complex 1.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Based on energetic considerations and in agreement with SQUID analysis (see section SQUID measurement), the models
         with one proton and either one or three organic radicals are too high in energy compared to the other configurations and
          will not be considered any longer. The model with three protons and three organic radicals appears as the most stable one,
           but a fully protonated state of the ligand is not supported by experimental data obtained from X-ray crystallography and
            High-Resolution Mass Spectroscopy (HRMS). Therefore, the hypothesis that matches the closest to the experimental results
             would be the presence of 3 HS Ni(II) centres (S = 1) and 2 organic radicals delocalized within the catechol-alloxazine
              ligand (SQ<sup>.</sup>, S=1/2), which is achieved by a partial protonation of the two flavin nitrogen (Figure 1).

    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><u><b>Modelling of magnetic interactions in model systems:</b></u></p>
    <p>
        According to our previous results, triangle 1 features SQ●-radicals delocalized in the vicinity of the Ni(II) ions, which 
        allows to describe the triangle as a system of three high spin Ni(II) ions (S = 1) and two SQ● radical (S = ½). This 
        generates a magnetic interaction between the paramagnetic centres that can be described by the exchange coupling constant 
        J using the HDvV Hamiltonian<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>  within the BS-DFT framework, 
        which will provide the theoretical magnetic sublevel spectrum to assign both ground and first excited states.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        The calculated exchange coupling constant for the Ni-SQ<sup>.</sup> pair, J<sub>Ni-SQ</sub>, for a model with 1 Ni-center and 1 radical, was found to be 131 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 
        which indicates a strong ferromagnetic interaction between the Ni(II) metal centre and the SQ<sup>.</sup>-radical, leading to a 
        quartet (S = 3/2) ground spin state with a doublet (S = 1/2) excited state lying at 393 cm<sup>-1</sup>. These results are in 
        excellent agreement with the experimental SQUID measurements, which proposed a strong ferromagnetic coupling within the 
        Ni-SQ<sup>.</sup> moiety.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">The magnetic orbitals for model A obtained from the BS-DFT calculations are reported in Figure 2.  These orbitals are 
        orthogonal, which is also consistent with the calculated overlap integral featuring a small magnitude of S = 0.009. 
        These data thus agree with a strong ferromagnetic interaction within this model.</p>
    <figure>
            <img src="./assets/picture_4_project_5.png" alt="Description of Image" class="centered-image-4"> 
            <figcaption class="image-caption" style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 2.</b> Magnetic orbital for the BS state of 
                model with 1 Ni-center and 1 radical. Hydrogen atoms from carbons were omitted for clarity.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    

    <p>In order to calculate the interaction between two Ni-SQ● moieties, a model with 2 Ni-centers and 2 radicals was used to 
        perform the BS-DFT calculation. The computed J<sub>(Ni-SQ)-(Ni-SQ)</sub> value for model B is 15 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which 
        indicates a weak ferromagnetic interaction between the two Ni(II) moieties which leads to a 7-fold (S = 3) ground spin 
        state with a quintet excited state (S =2) lying at 90 cm<sup>-1</sup>>. This is in fair agreement with the experimental 
        results, where a weak interaction between the two moieties was expected.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Upon combining a catechol-alloxazine ligand with a nickel ion, a unique trinuclear species was obtained and characterized
         in the solid state. Its electronic structure has been studied by a multidisciplinary approach combining several techniques.
          The presence of protons and ligand-based radicals was established, as well as the presence of high spin Ni(II) centres 
          strongly ferromagnetically coupled with semiquinone radicals, SQ<sup>.</sup>. Using the BS<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup> 
          approach within the DFT framework, we were able to predict and confirm both the electronic structure and the magnetic 
          interactions within this peculiar system. Using two model systems, our BS-DFT computations provided to two different exchange coupling constants, 
           J<sub>Ni-SQ</sub> = 131 cm<sup>-1</sup>  and J<sub>(Ni-SQ)-(Ni-SQ)</sub>  = 15 cm<sup>-1</sup> describing two types of interactions: (i) within the pair composed
            of the metal centre and the semiquinone radical, Ni-SQ, and (ii) between two pairs composed of the metal centres and 
            the semiquinone radicals, (Ni-SQ)–(Ni-SQ). These results are in fair agreement with the experimental data obtained 
            from SQUID measurements and further support that complex 1 can be best described as a triangle with two protons on the
             ligand and three high-spin Ni(II) ions combined to two ligand-based radicals.
