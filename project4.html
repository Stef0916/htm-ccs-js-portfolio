        <h2>Summary and Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Transforming solar energy into chemical energy is one of the most important processes sustaining life on earth. 
            In the case of photosynthesis, it involves the four-electron oxidation of dioxygen into water driven by solar 
            light.<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> Organisms that are able to convert light into fuel rely on a membrane protein called Photosystem II 
            (PSII). The active site of PSII, where the water oxidation occurs, is known as the oxygen-evolution complex (OEC),
             comprised of a Mn4O5Ca cluster (Figure 14a).<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup> Hence, catalytic water oxidation, as part of water splitting 
             strategies, could provide abundant fuels from renewable sources, which is much needed judging from the current 
             energetic crisis. Unfortunately, catalytic water oxidation is a global challenge representing the bottleneck 
             for water splitting, and much remains to be done. Taking inspiration from the OEC topology where PSII can 
             accumulate four electrons within a tetrametallic-oxo cluster, one can imagine a bioinspired model featuring 
             metal-oxo subunits, leading to “cubane”-type M4O4 complexes (Figure 1b).

    <h2>Implementation and Results</h2>

        <b>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</b> was used to compute (for further details on all the listed calculation and computational details <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cc03227e" target="_blank">View Publication</a>:

    <p>
        Full geometry optimizations of the two complexes using their X-ray crystal structures as starting points were performed 
        in the gas phase. Standard deviations were calculated and found in the range of DFT precision, i.e., 0.035–0.043 Å and 
        1.5–1.6° for bond lengths and angles of <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>, respectively. Single point calculations using the optimized geometries 
        provided electronic structures of the two complexes. From Mulliken spin population analysis (Figure 2), 
        we observe that around 92% of the spin density is distributed on the Ni(II) metal centres, as expected for the case of 
        a tetranuclear complex having four high spin (HS, S=1) Ni(II) ions.

    <p>
        Complexes 3 and 4 have four Ni(II) centres assumed to be in the high spin configuration due to their octahedral environments,
         thus each site features two unpaired electrons. Magnetic interactions between these paramagnetic centres are therefore 
         expected and can be described by the exchange coupling constant, J. BS-DFT was used to extract the six expected exchange 
         coupling constants J<sub>12</sub>, J<sub>13</sub>, J<sub>14</sub>, J<sub>23</sub>, J<sub>24</sub> and J<sub>34</sub> based on the eight 
          possible spin configurations of the system S = 4, Ms = 2 and Ms = 0 (3) (Figure 3).

    <p>
        For the methodology followed to extract the J values <a href="project6.html">go to project 6</a>. The following J values 
        were calculated: J<sub>12</sub> = 3.3 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2.0 cm<sup>-1</sup>, J<sub>13</sub> = 3.3 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2.9, J<sub>14</sub> = 1.7 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2.9 <sup>-1</sup>, J<sub>23</sub> = 1.6 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 
        4.0 cm<sup>-1</sup>, J<sub>24</sub> = 1.7 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2.9 cm<sup>-1</sup>, J<sub>34</sub> = 3.4 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1.6 cm<sup>-1</sup> for complexes 3 and 4, respectively. We thus observe 
        that all the calculated coupling constants between the nickel sites are positive, which demonstrates the presence of 
        ferromagnetic interactions between the paramagnetic centres, in agreement with previous experimental observations.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup>

    <ul class="custom-indentation">
        <li><u>Ligand exchange:</u> substitution of MeOH by H<sub>2</sub>O was considered, and a relaxed surface scan was utilized in order to 
            calculate the feasibility of this ligand exchange. A Gibbs free energy difference of -7.1 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> was obtained, 
            supporting the feasibility of the ligand exchange process.
        </li>
        <li><u>Cl dissociation:</u> After the first ligand exchange, the dissociation of one Cl anion from one Ni centre and the 
            formation of a bond between the metal centre and an external water molecule was investigated. As a result, Gibbs free 
            energy differences of 2.8 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> was obtained, supporting the feasibility of the ligand exchange process. 
        </li>
        <li><u>Ni<sup>II</sup> to Ni<sup>III</sup> oxidation:</u> oxidation processes of one nickel ion per water-substituted 
            cubane providing Ni(III) species within the [(&mu;<sup>3</sup></span>L<sup>n</sup>O<sub>)4</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> 
            complex was investigated by DFT calculations and lead to computed redox potentials of 1.16 V versus RHE. These two values are reasonably 
            close to the experimentally determined onset potentials for OER by complexes <b>3</b>, supporting the monoelectronic nature 
            of the observed electrochemical events.

        <li><u>Deprotonation of water molecule:</u> to prove that the reaction mechanism goes through an I2M mechanism, 
            the next expected step in the reaction mechanism is the exergonic deprotonation of a water molecule coordinated to 
            the formally Ni(III) centre. This step, which would result in the formation of a Ni(III)–OH moiety, is supported by 
            our DFT computations with calculated free energy differences of -31.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> for complex <b>3</b> using HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> as base at pH 7.

<!-- Conclusion -->
<section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The robust nickel cubanes <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> can be easily prepared in good yields from readily available starting materials under 
        ambient conditions. These tetranuclear complexes are active for electrocatalytic water oxidation at neutral pH as proven 
        by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. The BS-DFT approach was successfully employed in the study of the 
        magnetic properties of the Ni-cubanes, as well as to elucidate their ground-state electronic structure. Using the HDvV 
        Hamiltonian within the BS-DFT framework, we provided the computed magnetic sublevels that allow the assignment of both 
        ground and first excited states. Furthermore, theoretical reactivity studies confirmed the feasibility of the oxygen 
        evolution carried out by both Ni-cubanes.

        Extension of this self-assembly strategy for preparing other water oxidation catalysts with benzimidazole-based ligands
